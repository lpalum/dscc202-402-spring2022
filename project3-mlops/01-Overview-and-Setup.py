# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Before starting this course, you will need to create a cluster and attach it to this notebook.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Please configure your cluster to use the Databricks **ML Runtime** version **7.0 ML** which includes:
# MAGIC - Python Version 3.x
# MAGIC - Scala Version 2.11
# MAGIC - Apache Spark 2.4.4

# MAGIC ## ![Spark Logo Tiny](https://files.training.databricks.com/images/105/logo_spark_tiny.png) Classroom-Setup
# MAGIC In general, all courses are designed to run on one of the following Databricks platforms:
# MAGIC * Databricks Community Edition (CE)
# MAGIC * Databricks (an AWS hosted service)
# MAGIC * Azure-Databricks (an Azure-hosted service)
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC <img alt="Caution" title="Caution" style="vertical-align: text-bottom; position: relative; height:1.3em; top:0.0em" src="https://files.training.databricks.com/static/images/icon-warning.svg"/> Some features are not available on the Community Edition, which limits the ability of some courses to be executed in that environment. Please see the course's prerequisites for specific information on this topic.

# MAGIC <img alt="Caution" title="Caution" style="vertical-align: text-bottom; position: relative; height:1.3em; top:0.0em" src="https://files.training.databricks.com/static/images/icon-warning.svg"/> Additionally, private installations of Databricks (e.g., accounts provided by your employer) may have other limitations imposed, such as aggressive permissions and or language restrictions such as prohibiting the use of Scala which will further inhibit some courses from being executed in those environments.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC For each lesson to execute correctly, please make sure to run the **`Classroom-Setup`** cell at the start of each lesson (see the next cell) and the **`Classroom-Cleanup`** cell at the end of each lesson.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %run ./Includes/Classroom-Setup

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## ![Spark Logo Tiny](https://files.training.databricks.com/images/105/logo_spark_tiny.png) Classroom-Cleanup<br>
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC During the course of this lesson, files, tables, and other artifacts may have been created.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC These resources create clutter, consume resources (generally in the form of storage), and may potentially incur some [minor] long-term expense.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC You can remove these artifacts by running the **`Classroom-Cleanup`** cell below.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %run "./Includes/Classroom-Cleanup"
# MAGIC # notebook commands have been run

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Next Steps
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Start the lesson [Experiment Tracking]($./02-Experiment-Tracking).
