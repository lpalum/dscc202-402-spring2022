# MAGIC ### Tracking Experiments with MLflow
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Over the course of the machine learning life cycle, data scientists test many different models from various libraries with different hyperparameters.  Tracking these various results poses an organizational challenge.  In brief, storing experiments, results, models, supplementary artifacts, and code creates significant challenges.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC MLflow Tracking is one of the three main components of MLflow.  It is a logging API specific for machine learning and agnostic to libraries and environments that do the training.  It is organized around the concept of **runs**, which are executions of data science code.  Runs are aggregated into **experiments** where many runs can be a part of a given experiment and an MLflow server can host many experiments.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Each run can record the following information:<br><br>
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC - **Parameters:** Key-value pairs of input parameters such as the number of trees in a random forest model
# MAGIC - **Metrics:** Evaluation metrics such as RMSE or Area Under the ROC Curve
# MAGIC - **Artifacts:** Arbitrary output files in any format.  This can include images, pickled models, and data files
# MAGIC - **Source:** The code that originally ran the experiment
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC MLflow tracking also serves as a **model registry** so tracked models can easily be stored and, as necessary, deployed into production.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Experiments can be tracked using libraries in Python, R, and Java as well as by using the CLI and REST calls.  This course will use Python, though the majority of MLflow functionality is also exposed in these other APIs.

# MAGIC ### Experiment Logging and UI
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC MLflow is an open source software project developed by Databricks available to developers regardless of which platform they are using.  Databricks hosts MLflow for you, which reduces deployment configuration and adds security benefits.  It is accessible on all Databricks workspaces in Azure and AWS.

# MAGIC Log a basic experiment by doing the following:<br><br>
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC 1. Start an experiment using `mlflow.start_run()` and passing it a name for the run
# MAGIC 2. Train your model
# MAGIC 3. Log the model using `mlflow.sklearn.log_model()`

# MAGIC ### Parameters, Metrics, and Artifacts
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC But wait, there's more!  In the last example, you logged the run name, an evaluation metric, and your model itself as an artifact.  Now let's log parameters, multiple metrics, and other artifacts including the feature importances.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC First, create a function to perform this.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC <img alt="Side Note" title="Side Note" style="vertical-align: text-bottom; position: relative; height:1.75em; top:0.05em; transform:rotate(15deg)" src="https://files.training.databricks.com/static/images/icon-note.webp"/> To log artifacts, we have to save them somewhere before MLflow can log them.  This code accomplishes that by using a temporary file that it then deletes.

client = MlflowClient()

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md

# MAGIC ## Review
# MAGIC **Question:** What can MLflow Tracking log?  
# MAGIC **Answer:** MLflow can log the following:
# MAGIC - **Parameters:** inputs to a model
# MAGIC - **Metrics:** the performance of the model
# MAGIC - **Artifacts:** any object including data, models, and images
# MAGIC - **Source:** the original code, including the commit hash if linked to git
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC **Question:** How do you log experiments?  
# MAGIC **Answer:** Experiments are logged by first creating a run and using the logging methods on that run object (e.g. `run.log_param("MSE", .2)`).
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC **Question:** Where do logged artifacts get saved?  
# MAGIC **Answer:** Logged artifacts are saved in a directory of your choosing.  On Databricks, this would be DBFS, or the Databricks File System, which backed by a blob store.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC **Question:** How can I query past runs?  
# MAGIC **Answer:** This can be done using an `MlflowClient` object.  This allows you do everything you can within the UI programatically so you never have to step outside of your programming environment.
